Currently working as a Front End Developer with Resonance, Singapore.

A Recent graduate from General Assembly in Software Engineering Immersive Programme.

I was studying for my Bachelor of Electrical & Electronics Engineering in Melbourne, Australia. Prior to my studies, worked passionately in customer service with wide variety of companies.

Over the years, technology has been in my life and it clearly changed and directed me to gain knowledge with these technologies.

Affected by the pandemic, I started learning web development & ethical hacking. As my passion grew, I decided to pursue the IT industry as a professional career.
