Recent graduate from General Assembly in Software Engineering Immersive program.

I was studying for my Bachelor of Electrical & Electronics Engineering in Melbourne, Australia. Prior to my studies, worked passionately in customer service with wide variety of companies.

Affected by the pandemic, I started learning web development. As my passion grew, I decided to pursue it as a professional career.

What I enjoy the most is building on projects and seeing people use them once they are completed.
